// Speed-triggered performance timer: 0-100, 100-120, 120-160 and 0-200 km/h from one run
// (160-200 is kept for the log too). No drawing and no hardware here: it is fed the raw
// speed samples (value + the time they were published) and runs identically on the host.
//
//   open   -> car stopped (or stops)       -> STAGED ("READY!!")  at once, no hold time
//   STAGED -> speed leaves 0               -> RUN  (launch back-estimated from the first
//                                             two moving samples; a throttle sample can
//                                             start it earlier, see throttle())
//   RUN    -> 100 / 120 / 160 / 200 km/h   -> TE_SPLIT: the segment ending there is stamped
//   RUN    -> 200 km/h                     -> FINISH
//   RUN    -> speed drops 10 below its max, or no new top speed for 3 s (cruising)
//                                          -> SAVED with whatever it reached (top speed +
//                                             time to it, and every split passed); runs that
//                                             never got past 30 km/h are not logged
//   result -> stopped, or again()          -> STAGED for the next run
// Each threshold crossing is interpolated between the two samples around it, so the
// times are better than the sample rate (OBD speed is integer km/h at ~5-10 Hz).
